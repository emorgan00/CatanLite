Benjamin Avrahami and Ethan Morgan's APCS2 Final Project

[Development Log](https://github.com/emorgan00/CatanLite/blob/master/devlog.md)

This is the game of Catan, which supports at least two players (but should be four or less). 
Build settlements, roads and cities to hunt for resources, and be the first to 10 victory points!

Instructions:
The first thing to appear on the screen is a menu, which allows the user to input the number, names, and colors of the players. After that, there is a setup phase, where each player adds two settlements and two roads, which have to touch the corresponding settlement (in snake order).
