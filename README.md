Benjamin Avrahami and Ethan Morgan's APCS2 Final Project

[Development Log](https://github.com/emorgan00/CatanLite/blob/master/devlog.md)

immediate to do list: (all of these are things we can do right now without needing other parts working to build off of)
  * (tricky) add PlayerSelectEvent, with parameter cancellable (for choosing who to rob and potentially who to trade with)
  * (tricky) add ability to cancel build events, this should only be possible when setup == false
  * (hard) add CardSelectEvent, with a CardArray as parameter

down the line to do list: (no big deal if we don't get to these)
  * (hard) add the ability to highlight and unhighlight objects, this will be a huge aesthetic improvement
