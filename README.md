Benjamin Avrahami and Ethan Morgan's APCS2 Final Project

[Development Log](https://github.com/emorgan00/CatanLite/blob/master/devlog.md)

This is the game of Catan, which supports at least two players (but should be four or less). 
Build settlements, roads and cities to hunt for resources, and be the first to 10 victory points!
